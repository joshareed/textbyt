## Getting Started

To get started, text 'new' to 610-TEXTBYT (610-839-8298). The service will reply with a unique feed id. Anyone you share this feed id with can text messages to your Tidbyt.

To send your first message, start your text with `<name>@<feed id>`. The service will associate the name and feed id with your number so future texts will go to the same Tidbyt.
